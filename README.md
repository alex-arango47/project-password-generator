# Passblock Miner
My first project ever, it creates a random password out of an algorithm that I coded in which an random length of 1 and 0's get put together into blocks and then those blocks get transformed into strings, those strings then go through a filter and finally the password is generated, the hash has to have a specific length which is 55, so in a way the 'passblock' is being mined till it finds the right one.
